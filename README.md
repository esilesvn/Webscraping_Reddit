## Project Description

At this stage of the bootcamp, we discovered different ways to extract data from a website to create our own database. I worked on Reddit, "the front page of the Internet" which has very active and wide community and a lot of content on basically anything from humorous channels to subreddits about Python for example. Reddit has an existing API where you can find a lot of data into already nice shapes, but I wanted to exploit some other methodologies we talked about and discover how much I could extract from the "Gaming" Subreddit. 

The type of content mostly depends on the subreddit itself. On the "Gaming" one, there is a lot of pictures. But you can still extract the title, the author's username and the comments (which can be very messy due to the multiple layers : a comment on the post itself, then a comment on the previous comment, then a comment on the comment on the comment.. and you can go on and on ! But still, you can specify the level of comment you want). Depending on the target subject, extracting posts and comments, it could be a great tool to get the temperature & online behaviors of the users about an event, a release (movie, game, music...).

This methodology would not be the most relevant one, because you can extract a lot of data in a way more efficient way from the API, but it gave me a good idea on how to search and what to search to extract what I wanted and organize it into nice dataframes and get a first hand on what I've learned.
