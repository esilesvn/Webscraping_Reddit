Those are pretty good even today though, but if you think about it, even in perfectly photo realistic movies you can immediately tell something is CG the second it doesn't animate perfectly (like having the wrong weight, skin/muscles being a little off). We're still far from truly realistic but  even I play games sometimes and think ""these textures and polygon counts are good enough"" because often I can't see anything blurry even in closeups and we're moving away from sharp edges. We just need to keep improving lighting then we'll have minor gains with each console or GPU generation, so it'll be more about art style than realism.",,,
